## üí° Inspiration & Gratitude

I stumbled upon incredible music posters on Pinterest and was amazed by their uniqueness. Not finding a platform to create similarly diverse and appealing designs, I set out to develop a program that simplifies the process with just a few clicks and inputs. Surprisingly, the result exceeded my expectations, resulting in BeatPrints!

- A big shoutout to [@Magniquick](https://github.com/Magniquick) & [Krishna Gunjan](https://github.com/Krishna-Gunjan) for their big contribution!
