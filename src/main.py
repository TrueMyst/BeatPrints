"""
Module: main.py

This module serves as the main entry point for the BeatPrints application. 
It orchestrates the process of generating posters for songs, 
including fetching song information, processing images, and generating posters.

Dependencies:
    - pathlib: Provides an object-oriented interface for working with filesystem paths.
    - PIL: Python Imaging Library for image processing tasks.
    - image: Custom module for image processing functions.
    - lyrics: Custom module for retrieving and processing song lyrics.
    - spotify: Custom module for interacting with the Spotify API.
    - utils: Custom module containing utility functions.

Usage:
    Run this module to generate posters for songs based on user input.
