"""
Module: lyrics.py

This module provides functions for retrieving and processing song lyrics using the PyMusix library.

Dependencies:
    - os: Operating system interfaces (used for environment variables).
    - sys: System-specific parameters and functions (used for exiting the program).
    - rich: Rich text formatting for console output.
    - pymusix: Python wrapper for the MusixMatch API.
    - dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file.

Functions:
    - select_lines(lyrics, selection): Select specific lines from the lyrics based on the range.
    - get_extract(name, artist): Search for a song and retrieve a portion of its lyrics.

Usage:
    To use this module, ensure that you have the necessary environment variables set up:
    - SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID: Spotify client ID for accessing the MusixMatch API.
    - SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET: Spotify client secret for accessing the MusixMatch API.
    - MUSIXMATCH_USERTOKEN: User token for accessing the MusixMatch API.
